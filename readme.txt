Easily add strings to translate to your (child) theme or everywhere in your WordPress website.

== Description ==
Adds the wpml__ and wpml_e functions to your theme and the wpml__ shortcode to your WordPress website. Make your WordPress <strong>full WPML ready</strong>

<pre>&lt;?php wpml__( $text, $domain ); ?>
&lt;?php wpml_e( $text, $domain ); ?></pre>

Similarly to the behaviour of the __, _e functions, you must provide a string to make translateable and a domain.
That’s it; just provide translations from the WPML > String Translations admin panel.

Check how to use the shotcode below.

= Usage (via code) =
<pre>&lt;h1>&lt;?php echo wpml__( ‘Title’, ‘wpmlshortcodes’ ); ?>&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>&lt;?php wpml_e( ‘Subtitle’, ‘wpmlshortcodes’ ); ?>&lt;/h2></pre>

= Usage (via shortcode) =
<pre>&lt;h1>[wpml__ domain=wpmlshortcodes]Title[/wpml__]&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2>[wpml__ domain=wpmlshortcodes]Subtitle[/wpml__]&lt;/h2></pre>
